Taxi has been running since 1907 in New York. People have felt the importance of taxi as one of transportation mode, and that also include drivers who earned salary for living. My position here is a data analyst of agency who supplied driver for New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This agency does not only recruit manpower to work, but also brief strategies to our manpower so they could earn more. Agency will also benefit by receiving more income from the drivers.
